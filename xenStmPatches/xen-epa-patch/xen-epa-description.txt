Xen Patches for EPA-RIMM-Xen

These Xen patches were developed and should be applied over the stm-optin branch available on https://github.com/PPerfLab/xen.git for Xen 4.11. The stm-optin branch opts-in to STM if the BIOS supports STM.

For the 4.11 version of Xen, we have the dom0 kernel as a paravirtualized guest. For EPA-RIMM-Xen, we have added support for a few hypercalls so that the Ring0Manager (running in Domain0) can communicate with the hyerpvisor.

In Patch1: We added support for hypercall copy_to_xen and copy_from_xen, that allow the Ring0Manager to request a page from Xen for storing of Bin.  

In Patch2: We added support for Xen to invoke the GET_STM_PERFORMANCE VMCALL to collect STM performance data and provide it to the Ring0Manager. Do make sure while applying this pacth and using it that your Xen supports STM. 

Patch1 is necessary for EPA-RIMM-Xen to run as expected. You may apply Patch2 if you would like to get and understand STM Performance. 

Make sure you also apply the Linux patches. These linux and xen patches go hand-in-hand.

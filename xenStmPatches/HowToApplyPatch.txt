1. Apply xen Patches as: 
   a) Checkout stm-optin branch available on https://github.com/PPerfLab/xen.git 
   b) Once checked out, go to xen sources location on your system
   c)	git am <EPA-RIMM_source_location>/xenStmPatches/xen-epa-patch/0001*.patch --ignore-whitespace

   This will apply the patch starting with id 0001.
   This patch series is tested with xen-4.11
   This patch includes 1) 2 new hypercalls copy_to_xen and copy_from_xen required for EPA-RIMM's ring0manager to copy Dom0 space bin onto a xen space page.

   You may continue to run the command and apply individual patches by changing the patch id in the above command.

   You may also apply all the xen patches in 1 command. To do so, execute the git am command as:
      git am <EPA-RIMM_source_location>/xenStmPatches/xen-epa-patch/000*.patch --ignore-whitespace

2. Apply Linux Patch as:
   a) Checkout Linux kernel 4.11-rc8
   b) Goto linux sources on your system
   c)	git am <EPA-RIMM_source_location>/xenStmPatches/linux-epa-patch/0001*.patch --ignore-whitespace

   This Linux kernel patch has the support for the new hypercalls. 

   You may continue to run the command and apply individual patches by changing the patch id in the above command.

   You may also apply all the linux patches in 1 command. To do so, execute the git am command as:
      git am <EPA-RIMM_source_location>/xenStmPatches/linux-epa-patch/000*.patch --ignore-whitespace

3. Apply STM Patch:
   a) Checkout latest STM code base from its git tree
   b) Goto STM sources on your system
   c)  git am <EPA-RIMM_source_location>/xenStmPatches/stm-epa-patch/0001*.patch --ignore-whitespace

   In order to compile and integrate STM with UEFI code base, follow the steps given in "Updated_STM_Integration_Notes.txt" file
